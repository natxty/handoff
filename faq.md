# FAQ #

Once upon a time, the [FAQ section](https://theidealists.com/#faq) was database-driven, with admin pages to add, edit, order and delete. 

Now, the FAQ sections are simply written into the View template of the home page (and a separate stand-alone page for logged-in users who do not have access to the home page).

You may disregard the `FaqsController.php`. It was left here in the event that we returned to an administratable FAQ section at some future point.
