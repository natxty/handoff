# SHIFT #

We are currently an "app" within the [SHIFT ecosystem](http://www.shift.com/) which is a service for managing media and such for Facebook campaigns and the like.

The basic functioning is to access our site via an iframe from within the SHIFT platform. 

However, installation, messaging, security, and the like all have particular need so we created our own Plugin to manage.

After a great deal of coding and testing and succesful integration, there hasn't been any usage of the "app" on the SHIFT side. 

Therefore, I wouln't dig into this until there's a compelling need.
