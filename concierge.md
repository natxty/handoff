# Concierge Posts #

As opposed to the guided SOW form at `/creative-talent` (or, really, `/post`), the **_Concierge_** page is a simple form submission, which saves to the database (`concierges` table) and emails an admin.

Subsequent to this, the admin would enter the details on the `/creative-talent` page themselves.
