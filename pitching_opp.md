# Pitching for Opportunities #

Code for submitting a pitch (in code terms this means creating an entry on a Talentlist) is also included on the Opportunity view page via Backbone `webroot/scripts/backbone/view/opportunity.apply.js`; there is some old code from the credit-card processing era located in `webroot/js/opportunity.submit.js` <-- it's possible much of this is unused.
